# Code review exercise

## Background

As part of the interview process, we ask candidates to review some code so that we can get an understanding of your technical abilities and how you communicate about code.

Reviewing other developers work is a typical lead developer activity, and a useful way of keeping an eye on the general technical implementation direction of your team.  

This repository contains details of a small and relevant problem with a senior developer's coding solution. There is a solution written in Javascript and also a solution written in C#.  You'll choose one of these solutions to review.

### Instructions

- Choose either the JS or the C# solution to review
- Spend 30 mins reviewing the code
- Spend 15 mins feeding back to the panel your code review findings (This isn't long and you won't be able to cover everything so think about what is most important to discuss)

### What we're assessing
This exercise will help us to assess:

- Your approach to upholding good engineering standards
- How you hold others to account for their development work
- Your communication skills

### Our questions

We'll be asking the following questions
- How happy are you with the overall solution submitted?
- What high level feedback would you provide to the author?
- Are there any changes you would ask for?
