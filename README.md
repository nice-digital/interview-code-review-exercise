# Code review exercise

## Background

As part of the interview process, we ask candidates to review some code so that we can get an understanding of your technical abilities and how you communicate about code.

Reviewing other developers work is a typical lead developer activity, and a useful way of keeping an eye on the general technical implementation direction of your team.  

This repository contains details of a small and relevant problem with a senior developer's coding solution. There is a solution written in Javascript and also a solution written in C#.  You'll choose one of these solutions to review.  

### Code review exercise instructions
- Read the [Problem specification](PROBLEM-SPEC.md)
- Choose *either* the JS or the C# solution to review
- Spend up to 30 mins reviewing the code, its up to you how you gather your feedback.
- Spend 15 mins sharing your code review feedback to the interview panel 

For guidance, we'll be asking the following questions
- How happy are you with the overall solution submitted?
- What high level feedback would you provide to the author?
- Are there any changes you would ask for?

### Things to consider
Lead developers often have a busy schedule and the timings of this exercise have been designed reflect that you probably don't have as much time as you might like to review.  This means that you probably won't be able to do a detailed analysis of everything in the solution, so think about what is most important to prioritise reviewing and feeding back.


### What we're assessing
This exercise will help us to assess:

- Your high level knowledge of a programming language, testing and good code design
- Your approach to upholding good engineering standards
- How you hold others to account for their development work
- Your communication skills
